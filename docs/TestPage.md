# Emoti-OS

**I found some information about a project i-DAT did called Emoti-OS, which is a chat bot designed to find out the collective mood of students at the college of art**

Emoti-OS was a way for students from the Plymouth College of Arts to express how they felt about the course and uni life anonymously to an AI, to avoid the awkwardness of complaining to a real human. Developed in 2017, Emoti-OS was designed specifically to recognise emotions and give emotional responses.

Whilst a version of Emoti-OS is available for smart-phones or in browser use, the main exhibit was a monitor hooked up to 7 emotive buttons.
